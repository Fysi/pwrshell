## What are you doing?!

The purpose of this repository is to act as a bit of a demo space. When we publish things online, it's unlikely we're going to make the big time and have pull requests flying about.
Rather than aim there with such limited coding knowledge and little in the way of ambitions for an Open Source project, I hope anyone stumbling upon this instead sees what the beginnings of a journey into a scripting language can contain. I've begun separating the random bits of code flying about into purposes, such as a Word of the Day script I've been using for donkeys that just pops up a word each login in my Scheduled Tasks.

Hopefully this is useful for someone out there. If not, it's at least good practise for me! 

## What's in this place?
Okay, so we've got:
* Egnyte  - Simple connect script for their API
* Messing Around  - Ways of doing bits to other computers (playing songs/sounds/showing jokes from a Chuck Norris API, etc.)
* ScheduledTasks  - Things I run from Task Scheduler making my day easier / more engaging
* bitlocker  - A better Bitlocker script than those out on the web, with some proper error handling for SCCM deployment

The rest of the repository is loose ps1s with various purposes.
If I can highlight one thing, I like to think my Powershell profile makes using Powershell much more friendly.

## Can I..?

As long as it's within the license, do as you please. I'll repond to any questions, PRs, whatever.
If you've got strict requirements at your place of work on using code / not able to republish source - get in touch. Happy to discuss.
